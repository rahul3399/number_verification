# Introduction: 
Having invalid data in your database can be a nightmare. Especially if you are intending to use the data to do things like sending important SMS to your users. A typical solution is to use /Regular Expressions/gi to make sure the value at least looks like a phone number, but that still doesnâ€™t prevent someone from entering a fake number and supporting international numbers makes it even harder. So this is the perfect solution for testing the mobile number using numverify API.
